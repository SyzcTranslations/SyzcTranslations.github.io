Hey Everyone,

Here's more chapters.

Some games I bought finally arrived, so I haven't been translating as quickly. I'll be taking a bit of time to play God Wars: Future Past, Valkyria: Revolutions, and Fire Emblem: Shadows of Valentia Echoes. I'm also playing Dig or Die with some friends xD. Don't worry though, I'll at least do my 1 chapter a day, and there is a long weekend coming up!

Any other JRPG fans out there? :)

Well, enjoy.
