Hello Everyone,

Here's a bunch more chapters. To be honest, I didn't find these ones as interresting, but they still had their funny moments.

[Chapter 34][vwpwe0034]

It's really exciting seeing the same few people come back and comment with every release. I hope you all continue to enjoy the novel. It's also exciting see more votes, reviews and just people adding it to their reading list on novel updates. I feel like the number increases every day!

Sadly I tried getting some people I know to try reading it, but they found it boring without even finishing the first chapter T.T

Well, enjoy the read everyone.
