Yo!

Recently I found that my translations have been copied and hosted on some aggregator sites without any mention of my site or alias. Heck, it's only been a few days since I started and it's already happening...

So I rushed to release this chapter because I wanted to test some things. Hopefully something I do will help.

Anyone have any advice for dealing with this sorta thing?

Also, a poll:

Enjoy!
