Hey Everyone,

I feel like there was less humor in this set of chapters (There is still some laughs, don't worry). Instead we see traces of horror (for me at least), and some serious scenes where we learn more about the characters. I hope I manage to convey the feelings I got while reading it to everyone.

[Chapter 51][vwpwe0051].

Since last update, I've noticed there is now a discussion thread and much more reviews on novel updates! So exciting xD. Soon it will be on 1000 reading lists and has many 5 star reviews. I'm glad everyone's enjoying it.

I've also started regretting putting Virtual World on the title. I feel like people would see it and lose interrest. Do you think It's hard to get it changed on novel updates?

Enjoy!
