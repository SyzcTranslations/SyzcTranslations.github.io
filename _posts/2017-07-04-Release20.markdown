Hey Everyone,

Unfortunately, the translator for the spanish version has become too busy and will no longer be translating it.

I will keep going with the english translations for everyone though. To be honest, I'm getting super annoyed that they are still in a beginner village after over 100 chapters... hopefully, they get out of it soon.

Anyways, did all you canadians out there enjoy the holiday?
